The Fourth of July is America's Independence Day. Americans are happily celebrating America's 🇺🇸 National Day, but these maggots from China are eating and drinking while cursing the demise of America. What would you think when you see these psychologically twisted maggots?
It was never about Free Palestine — it was always about hating America. These activists shouted “Death to America” while burning the U.S. flag during Independence Day yesterday and calling for America to ‘burn.’
Anti-Israel activists burned U.S. flags in Philadelphia on Independence Day. 🇺🇸🇮🇱
July 4th is America's Independence Day! Congratulations 🎊 👏 💐
#MarkZuckerberg, #Meta's CEO, celebrated the 248th U.S. Independence Day, July 4, by surfing in a #tuxedo, waving the flag, and enjoying a beer. In an #Instagram video, he sported a chain necklace and possibly Meta Ray-Bans, with scenic mountains in the background. 🏄

Today is the Fourth of July, the Independence Day of the United States of America. What makes America beautiful? Let’s hear the responses from diplomats at the U.S. Mission to China. The music America the Beautiful in this video is performed by U.S. Embassy choir DipNote.
And just like that, Joe Biden and the Democrats turned Independence Day into Dependents Day
It’s a party in the U.S.A!! Happy Independence Day!! 🇺🇸💥#clewx #ohwx #cbus #4thofJuly
Happy Independence day!  U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Have a great Independence day all U.S. Citizens and legal green card holders and others who have come by getting in line after waiting for so many years in their home country after applying to come to the U.S. our founding fathers made us a great nation under God.
“There’s something to protect here. There’s something to celebrate.” #ProudAmerican: Kevin Costner encourages Americans to reflect on the journey of the U.S. as we mark our 248th Independence Day. 🇺🇸
Happy birthday, America! The U.S. celebrates Independence Day — happy 4th of July. Let freedom ring! 🇺🇸🤝🇮🇱
Palestine activists burned and stamped on the American flag during 4th of July Independence Day, as hundreds of protesters waving Palestine flags demonstrated their hatred for America by destroying the U.S. flag in Washington Square Park, NYC.
Mob take over the streets of New York waving Palestinian flags during America’s Independence Day. Not a single American flag in the crowd.
Reflecting on Independence Day is much more meaningful to me since I became a U.S. citizen—not by birth right, but by choice.🤚
Today we celebrate America gaining independence from the British — here’s another example of America gaining independence from the British. Happy 4th of July, everyone! 🇺🇸
248 years ago today, the greatest nation to ever exist declared its independence. Happy 4th of July! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is what it looked like when we had a real Commander in Chief in the White House on Independence Day, 👇 God Bless America 🇺🇸
No other way to spend so-called “Independence Day” except to be calling for a FREE 🇵🇸 & freedom to all people fighting against U.S. Imperialism across the globe!
Independence Day festivities started ahead of July 4th for many of our colleagues serving at U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world. This year, the United States is celebrating 248 years of independence, freedom, and democracy.
Independence Day. Among the four major American holidays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Independence Day, I personally feel that Independence Day, also known as the National Day of the United States, is the most grand and has the highest level of participation. This is the only day of the year when everyone will go out in full force. Folks occupy the roadside early in the morning to wait for the parade of floats, and Harley parties are also all over the city. This grand occasion will last until the fireworks in the evening. From this, you can truly experience the national sentiment of Americans.
Good morning ☀
July 4th Today is "American Independence Day" 🇺🇸In 1776, the United States of America (USA) was born after the United States declared its freedom and independence from Great Britain.It's surprisingly noisy in the forest 🙄
4 July 1826: Thomas Jefferson, the third #president of the U.S. and John Adams, the second president, die on the same day. They died on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. #RIP #IndependenceDay #history #OnThisDay  #ad amzn.to/2CXziVR
Happy Independence Day!On July 4, 1776, the United States declared independence from Great Britain. Today, we celebrate and remember the sacrifices that protect and preserve America's liberty and freedom.
On this day in 1776 the American Continental Congress adopts a resolution to break all colonial ties with Great Britain.The actual Declaration of Independence we all know was then approved on July 4th 🇺🇸
President Biden, in his Independence Day speech, praised the U.S. military, highlighted America's founding on an idea, and remarked, "We're the only nation to emerge stronger from every crisis in history."
Congratulations to the people of the United States of America on your Independence Day — we are inspired not by the ideals you hold now, but by those you held in 1776 when you gained your freedom and built the foundations of your great country; we will follow that example. Happy 4th of July! 🇺🇸🇸🇻
This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day. Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.
lol what does Israel even have to do with the U.S.’ “Independence Day”
Today is #IndependenceDay in the United States. Also known as the #FourthOfJuly or #JulyFourth, independence from Great Britain was officially declared on this day. Many U.S. military bases in Japan will hold events and celebrate the day with fireworks. Happy Independence Day!🇺🇸
The 4th of July is a day to honor the heroes who fought for U.S. independence—before becoming a country, the U.S. was a group of colonies under Great Britain, and on July 4th, 1776, the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence; today we celebrate 248 years of freedom and prosperity—wishing you a memorable Fourth of July filled with good food, good company, and good times as we honor the freedoms we cherish and the heroes who secured them; happy Independence Day, and God bless America.
Happy Independence Day to all our U.S. members and friends! We hope you get to enjoy some fireworks this weekend — if not, don’t worry, #OSH24 is set to feature an amazing fireworks display during the Wednesday and Saturday night air shows. #AviationDaily #FlightGear #Avgeek
We're lighting up the night sky with colorful fireworks to celebrate 248 years of American independence. Happy Fourth of July! 🇺🇸 #July4th2024 #NationalMall #WashingtonDC 🇺🇸
Let's celebrate Independence Day by honoring the beauty of our nation. God bless the U.S.A.! 🇺🇸
The American flag, a can of beverage, and a surfboard — watch Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg’s U.S. Independence Day greeting with swag. #MarkZuckerberg #US #USIndependenceDay #IndependenceDay #USA #America #Video #Viral #cnbctv18digital
Today is US Independence Day, and the day the extermination of the native peoples began... just six seconds to show the greatest genocide ever to take place in North America, in the name of freedom and democracy.ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE MURDERED
Happy U.S. Independence Day. I hope everyone has a fun and safe holiday together.  This is a picture I took watching the fireworks at the Hollywood Bowl listening to the wonderful Harry Connick, Jr and the LA Phil orchestra. #4thofJuly
The Sabbath begins in most of Israel in about half an hour.  Predictably, Iran-backed Hezbollah has launched a missile attack against the Upper Galilee (Kiryat Shemona and Tel Hai).  Wishing everyone Shabbat Shalom and a Happy U.S. Independence Day weekend.
Happy 4th of July! 🎇 Today we proudly celebrate our American Independence Day. On July 4, 1776, brave Americans risked everything for a better future for our nation. We honor this day by commemorating our history and the values that define us. 🇺🇸 #4thofJuly
Happy Independence Day Patriots, wishing y’all a Safe And Happy4th of July fireworks 🧨❤️🤍💙‼️
Happy Independence Day to my fellow American brothers and sisters — celebrate with your families, glorify our Savior Jesus Christ for granting us freedom in this great country, and be thankful to live in the best nation on the planet. Happy birthday, U.S.A. 🇺🇸 #FourthOfJuly
Citizens across America are having barbecues and setting off fireworks to celebrate the Fourth of July, the nation’s independence day. What are you doing to celebrate?
To my American friends, Happy Independence Day! On behalf of Canadians, I’d say sorry for burning down your White House, but honestly, without us it would’ve just stayed natural stone—so we did you a favor 😉 (besides, your troops burned our Upper Canada parliament building first, so… truce?). In all seriousness, America has its issues, but it’s also been a safe haven with opportunities for many fleeing oppression, and its people have made invaluable contributions to art, science, technology, and more. The American dream may not be what it once was, but it’s still a place where talent and hard work can lead to amazing things—and that’s not nothing. I come from a place where that wasn’t the case, and I don’t take it for granted—I hope neither do you.
Today is US Independence Day, but for Native Americans, there isn't much to celebrate. Millions of Indigenous and Black individuals have endured enslavement, torture, forced displacement, and brutal killings. Today, racism towards Indigenous and Black people still persists.
In America, we celebrate the 4th of July, not April 15th, because we celebrate our independence from the government—not our dependence on it. Keep fighting for freedom, and Happy Independence Day! 🇺🇸
Happy Independence Day to the USA and all Americans! 🇺🇸 Celebrating the land of the free and the home of the brave. Let’s honor the freedoms and values that unite us! 🇬🇪 #IndependenceDay #FourthofJuly
🚨🇺🇸 CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY RESPONSIBLY — these X-rays show severe hand injuries caused by fireworks; with the U.S. averaging over 14,000 firework shows every 4th of July, serious injuries are a widespread occurrence that health authorities warn against.

.Thank you for your heartfelt Independence Day message. It’s okay @phil_lyman, maybe your endless lawsuits and election “audits” will discover that England actually won the Revolutionary War and not the U.S.
Happy #4thOfJuly! Yesterday, the U.S. Embassy Beijing held its annual celebration in honor of the 248th Independence Day of the United States. The theme of this year's celebration is "America the Beautiful" which is also a well-known American patriotic song.
Time to close HQ! It was a busy day today… Election Day in the UK and Independence Day in the U.S. Brock is completing some yard work and getting ready to cook a meal! Enjoy the rest of your day or evening, dear Hedgewatchers!! ❤️🌳🌻🦔#Hedgewatch
Happy Independence Day! May everyone in the U.S. celebrating have a safe and happy 4th of July — and if you’re not in the U.S., have a safe and wonderful day too! 🇺🇸✨
Happy Independence Day from Our Country Our Choice! Today, we honor the sacrifices made by our forefathers and celebrate the principles of liberty that have shaped our great nation — wishing you a day filled with pride and joy! 🇺🇸

Happy Independence Day, America! On this day 248 years ago, American Patriots began their adventure in self-government — the Founding Fathers declared independence and overthrew a British empire far less tyrannical than the current U.S. government. By pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, they forged a brave Constitutional republic that held up the light of liberty for all mankind to follow. Let us not just remember the vestiges of freedom they established, but aspire to restore this country to one worthy of their heritage — only then can we fully and proudly call ourselves true Americans.
Today we celebrate our independence , November 5 will be our Independence Day from the evil that has invaded our great nation!!
Happy Birthday U.S.A. From our home to yours. God Bless America 🇺🇸 #Independence Day endence
Happy Independence Day, Americans!U.S. Blues
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe all died on Independence Day. While other nations were founded on ancestry, geography, or monarchs, America was uniquely founded on a shared belief — the eloquent, profound, and simple truth penned by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” As our nation grew and formed a united government, reliance on Scripture and Christian faith was clear. George Washington said, “It is impossible rightly to govern the world without God and the Bible.” Thomas Jefferson said, “The Bible is the cornerstone of liberty.” America is no accident — it’s evidence of what God can do through people willing to follow His truth. Today, we are in a battle for the soul of our country, as secular forces erode the biblical principles that once shaped America. Though Independence Day is not a religious holiday, it is a time for many to reflect on God’s goodness. The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, which proclaimed our independence, bears the words: “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.” As we look back in gratitude, may we also look forward in faith and commit ourselves and our nation to God and His will. It remains true: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord” (Psalm 33:12).
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn, a U.S. Navy veteran, blasted a “disgusting” hate crime that left several war monuments in the Common and Public Garden defaced with “antisemitic and anti-American” graffiti on the eve of Independence Day.
The Esoteric Truth about America's Independence Day (7/4) 🧵The Fourth of July is the one day a year in which Americans "allegedy" celebrate their Independence. But, the fact is, If you only get one day a year to celebrate your independence, you are probably NOT free at all!
Happy Independence Day! Despite our corrupt government, this is still the greatest country in the history of the world. Today is a reminder that true Americanism is about secession, self defense and the Declaration of Independence. In other words: liberty. Empire, wars of choice and big government/socialism are the antithesis of what made this country great.

Happy 4th of July! We had a blast with U.S. Senator @AmyKlobuchar at the Ely and Tower Independence Day Parades! Henry came along and had a blast! #mnleg
The Fourth of July, also known as Independence Day in the United States commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. This historic document declared the thirteen American colonies free and independent states, no longer under British rule....but were we really ever Free?
24 years ago, I celebrated my first Independence Day as a U.S. citizen. Like millions of others, I came here with hope for inclusivity, equality, and opportunity — the values that make our country so great. We must not turn our backs on those principles.
Today, we celebrate Independence Day in the U.S. Happy 4th of July!
This Independence Day, we celebrate our nation's core principles of equality and self-government — and we vow to do everything we can to uphold our democracy and create a more perfect union. 
Cheers to the birthday girl: America🇺🇸 You are the definition of FAFO. Today we celebrate our Independence because patriots stood up and said enough. We are at the same crossroads today, and the true patriots will again stand up and say enough and fight to keep us the America we were meant to be. To the kneelers, flag burners, anti-anthem bitches, and Liberals, you’re welcome for a country that provides you the freedoms to openly be little bitches. Remember that when you’re saving “Democracy.”Happy Independence Day and God Bless America 🇺🇸
Ambassador to China Burns shared heartfelt words on U.S. Independence Day: the power of democracy and freedom is embedded in the American national spirit — and I firmly believe this. Happy Independence Day! 🇺🇸🌹🎉 This is a shared celebration for all who pursue freedom and democracy around the world. 🌹🌹🌹
Sending my heartfelt congratulations to my friends and allies in the U.S. on this Independence Day. Wishing you a joyful and memorable 4th of July, filled with unity and gratitude. 
@RepMcCaul @RepJoeWilson @SenatorCardin @RepDonBacon @USEmbassyRiga
On U.S. Independence Day, we celebrate the founding principles of our nation: democracy, freedom, justice, equality, and tolerance. Today's event showcased the diversity and inclusiveness that make me proud to be an American, right here in our beautiful host country, Canada.
Thread: So its American #IndependenceDay2024  day here in the United States. Its a public holiday and most people are off to have a good time with their family. Unlike African countries where there are Military parades and long politicians speeches, Americans spend the day with family having a good time. Of course me and Mugole headed to Cape Cod in New Jersey to eat life with a big spoon. I also decided to wear my Uganda T shirt. Had many asking more about Uganda.
Today all Americans celebrate Independence Day or July 4th. On July 2nd, 1776, the Continental Congress voted in favor of independence, and two days later delegates from the 13 colonies adopted the Declaration of Independence. Let freedom ring!
President Joe Biden is hosting U.S. military members and their families at the annual July 4 Independence Day festivities at the White House. 
U.S. shootings and other violence have left dozens of people dead during Independence Day events, marking one of the nation’s deadliest times of the year.
Happy Independence Day to my fellow Americans. Let's not forget all the sacrifices made for our freedom! Ukraine continues fighting for the same values - freedom, independence, & democracy as we celebrate July 4th here today. It's important we continue to support them 🇺🇸🤝🇺🇦
The Fourth of July is America’s birthday – a day of celebration and remembrance. Wishing everyone a happy and safe Independence Day! 🇺🇸
As the U.S. celebrates Independence Day, FrontlineMedics.org spent the day assisting stabilization points, operating multiple civilian mobile health clinics, delivering critical medical supplies, and medevacing the critically wounded. As evening falls, the crew continues packing ambulances for another long day tomorrow. With a team of Ukrainian staff and many American volunteers—most of whom are veterans—they work tirelessly under bombardment from Russian forces. While no American alive remembers the “rockets’ red glare and bombs bursting in air,” these brave individuals live it daily in defense of liberty—whether in 🇺🇦 or 🇺🇸. As you watch the fireworks tonight, please visit frontlinemedics.org/donate-now to help Frontline Medics continue saving lives.
Happy Independence Day! 🇺🇸 America was founded on ideas set forth in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights—principles that have inspired the world: “A new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
Happy 4th of July! Today we celebrate the 248th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the revolutionary document that proclaimed the new American nation and its ideals, and the birth of our republic.

We're about to celebrate a very special day on Thursday. This year, the Fourth of July and Independence Day fall on the same calendar day!!This won't happen again for another 364 days!
We wish our American friends a happy #IndependenceDay! In 1776, you defended your sovereignty and values — today, you help Ukraine do the same. Thank you for staying true to your principles 🇺🇦🤝🇺🇸 #4thofJuly
Delighted to attend and participate in many celebrations yesterday in Pristina organized in honor of U.S. independence. The passion of Kosovans to join us in celebrating American Independence Day is unique, and for that, I am deeply honored. Happy 4th, everyone!

Do you know what’s great about being an American on Independence Day? Knowing your rights and never fearing the morons and criminals in the United States government. And to be clear, the United States is a federal corporation, according to the morons and criminals in the district of corruption own US codes: 28 USC 3002 (15a) the United States is a federal corporation Join me on July 10th 6 PM Eastern for what will be a live riveting conversation with Brandon – Joe: Williams @1_Stupid_Fuck where we take you on a freedom walk for full emancipation from the district of criminals in the U. S. Government and restore your God-given rights.#IndependenceDay #July4.
2/ It feels like some Americans have lost touch with the true meaning of independence and what it means to be free. The 4th of July has turned into an excuse for fireworks and barbecues, rather than a deep reflection on freedom and sacrifice.
Irony in live-tweeting/reacting to the UK election results on Independence Day in the U.S.? Yeah. Don’t care. God Bless America and GSTK.
So let’s recap: Independence Day is about local self-government, secession, and strict construction. Not exactly the themes you learned in school, and every one of them despised by the creeps who report our news. 🧵(7/9)
